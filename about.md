I'm Morgan. I'm a \*NIX geek that loves working on the back-end; writing efficient application code and creating secure environments to deploy it in. I write software for [Copart](https://github.com/moshorter-copart) and tinker with side projects when I find the time. This site is mostly for the latter.

I'm always looking for excuses to learn and use new and different technology: lisp, lua, Erlang, containers/jails, distributed systems, data crunching, security in all parts of the stack; the more open-source-y, the better.

## Work

I've worked on projects using a variety of popular web stacks, including:

* Python/Django
* Nginx, Apache
* GNU/Linux
* Java/Spring Boot
* Node, React, Redux, jQuery
* etc.

I've worked on e-commerce sites, blogs, static sites, API's, and the odd utility script here and there. Help me add to the list :)

Have a question? Want to work with me? Connect with me on [LinkedIn]({{ site.author.url }}) or [GitHub]({{ site.github.profile }}) :)
