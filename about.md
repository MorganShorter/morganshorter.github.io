title: About
---
I'm Morgan. I'm a programmer (among other things), and this website is where I post raves about my hobby projects, shower thoughts about technology, and other interesting bits of internet flotsam.

This site, of course, is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, including but not limited to the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, especially reading. Expect an erratic publishing schedule and breaking changes to the code.

Some projects I'm currently working on include:
---

+ Learning the subtleties of serving and securing data on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
+ Re-purposing old hardware
+ Doing interesting and novel things with DNS, routing tables, firewalls, TLS, and VPN software
+ Deleting systemd, wayland, and other garbage from my life (welcome back, Slackware, old friend)
+ Attempting to reach peak dotfiles perfection
+ This website
+ Learning R5RS and C
+ Finding ways to leverage FOSS to facilitate medical care and research
