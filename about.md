title: About
---
I'm Morgan. I write software, do IT (Dev)Ops, and even occasionally write articles. This website is where I post raves about my hobby projects, shower thoughts about technology, and other interesting bits of internet flotsam. Some of my personal interests and work projects can be found on this page.

This site, of course, is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, including but not limited to the warranty of fitness for any particular purpose, especially reading. Expect an erratic publishing "schedule" and breaking changes to the code.

# Work

I've worked in a wide range of roles, industries, and organizations. Some notable ones include being a technical expert in producing aged cheeses at an agriculture R&D think-tank owned by the monarchy of Thailand, working on ERP software for the worlds largest auto salvage auction company, and selling things--all the things. You can read more about my ~~riveting tales of for-profit adventure~~ work experience at [LinkedIn]({{ site.author.url }}), which is also where you can reach me if you're interested in working with me.

I am currently freelance, primarily working on DevOps and Infrastructure stuff for [DjaoDjin](https://djaodjin.com). They do the heavy lifting of handling secure billing, access control, resource provision, and user management for customers that range from micro-SaaS start-ups to large industry compliance platforms; all while releasing their entire stack as Free and Open Source Software. They're great people who make great software; I'm a huge fan.
