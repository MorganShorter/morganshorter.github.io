  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Morgan. I write software, do (Dev)Ops, and even occasionally write articles. This website is where I post raves about my hobby projects, shower thoughts about technology, and other interesting bits of internet flotsam. Some of my personal interests and work projects can be found on this page.</p>

<p><em>This site is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, including but not limited to the warranty of fitness for any particular purpose, especially reading. Expect an erratic publishing “schedule” and breaking changes to the code.</em></p>

<p>I’ve worked in a wide range of roles, industries, and organizations. Some notable ones include being a subject matter expert on producing aged cheeses at an agriculture R&amp;D think-tank owned by the monarchy of Thailand, working on ERP software for the worlds largest auto salvage auction company, and selling things–all the things.

<p>I am currently freelancing, primarily working on DevOps and Infrastructure stuff at <a href="https://djaodjin.com">DjaoDjin</a>. They do the heavy lifting of handling secure billing, access control, resource provision, and user management for customers that range from micro-SaaS start-ups to large industry regulatory bodies. The do all this while releasing their entire stack as Free and Open Source Software. They’re a great team making great products; I’m a huge fan.</p>
